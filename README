Gedit Scroll Paste Fix
===================================

This plugin fixes GTK's scrolling behaviour when pasting text with the mouse.
By default when text is pasted using the mouse in a text view the view scrolls
to the current cursor position and not to where the text has been pasted. This
is extremely annoying specially when pasting text in another screen page.

Building
========

This project uses autoconf & friends as its build toolchain. Building it should
be trivial once the GNU autoconf toolchain is installed.

In Debian based systems the build dependencies can be easily installed by
doing:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool gnome-common libgtksourceview2.0-dev gedit-dev

If you have forked the code from github you will need to run the autoconf
programs in order to prepare build toolchain:

  ./autogen.sh

Once the toolchain scripts are created simply build the program with:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install

A faster way is to pass the arguments of ./configure directly to ./autogen.sh
this way the command becomes:

	./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install
