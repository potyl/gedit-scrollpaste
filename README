Gedit Scroll Paste Fix
===================================

This plugin fixes GTK's scrolling behaviour when pasting text with the mouse.
By default when text is pasted in a text view using the mouse the view scrolls
to the current cursor position and not to where the text has been pasted. This
is extremely annoying specially when pasting text in another location that's far
away from the cursor.

Building
========

This project uses autoconf & friends as its build toolchain. Building it should
be trivial once the GNU autoconf toolchain is installed.

In Debian based systems the build dependencies can be easily installed by
doing:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool gnome-common
  sudo apt-get install libgtksourceview2.0-dev gedit-dev

To install on Fedora, make sure you have a working toolchain installed and the
build dependencies:

  sudo yum install gcc make autoconf automake libtool gettext
  sudo yum install gtksourceview-devel gedit-devel

For OS X the plugin can be either compiled for the macports versions or for
the native application installed through a native dmg image. For both versions
you first need to download and install gedit through the macports:

  sudo port install gedit gedit-plugins

If you have forked the code from github you will need to run the autoconf
programs in order to prepare build toolchain:

  ./autogen.sh

Once the toolchain scripts are created simply build the program with:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install

A faster way is to pass the arguments of ./configure directly to ./autogen.sh
this way the command becomes:

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install

For installing the native OS X version of the plugin pass --enable-osx to the
configuration script:

  ./autogen.sh --enable-osx && make && sudo make install
