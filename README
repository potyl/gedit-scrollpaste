Gedit Scroll Paste Fix
===================================

This plugin fixes GTK's scrolling behaviour when pasting text with the mouse.
By default when text is pasted using the mouse in a text view the view scrolls
to the current cursor position and not to where the text has been pasted. This
is extremely annoying specially when pasting text in another screen page.
